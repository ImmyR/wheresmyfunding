            "abstractText": "10 million people worldwide are blinded by scarring of the cornea. The ability to engineer biomimetic corneal components could improve quality of life. As a first step, we are working to treat limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) deficiency of the cornea, which causes painful, blinding surface failure. We have transplanted cultured LESCs to improve vision in patients with chemical burns. However, many patients have challenging diseases requiring a substrate to aid cell survival, in our case human amnion. This approach can improve vision, however, we have found the long-term therapeutic benefit to be variable. In part, we suspect, because cultured LESC sheets do not restore the normal LESC 'niche' destroyed by disease. We have made simple constructs of the human corneal surface. Novel technology (Real Architecture for 3D Tissues - RAFT) is used to make a fibroblast-seeded collagen I construct with surface topology that mimics the in vivo stem cell niche, with an epithelium on the surface. Our data are very promising, the epithelial cells grow successfully and produce an epithelium. RAFT constructs are reproducible and have significant advantages over human amnion for LESC culture. Amnion is biologially variable and often (40% of cases) does not support the growth of healthy LESCs. Here we will quantify RAFT mechanical strength, using a culture force monitor, as this must be sufficient to withstand surgery. Spectral transmission (transparency) will be measured as RAFT should ideally be at least as transparent amnion. We will test if RAFT is safe to use and if it can improve the surface of a cornea with LESC deficiency with our Japanese collaborators using an established rabbit model of LESC deficiency. If successful this data will inform GMP compliant standard operating procedures for therapeutic RAFT production. IoO have the experience and capacity to manufacture GMP compliant RAFT constructs in the 'Cells for Sight Cell Therapy Research Unit'.",
            "potentialImpactText": "Academics, clinicians, commercial private sector, policy makers, patients, charities will benefit from this research.\nAcademics interested in the research areas of regenerative medicine, corneal biology, stem cell regulation, cell-cell interactions, tissue engineering and reducing the use of animals in experiments will benefit from having a simple, easy to make and reliable model of human tissue to adapt for their own research.\nClinical academics interested in enhancing healthspan, alleviating the effects of ocular surface failure and corneal disease will have a model in which to test new concepts and therapies. \nThe concept of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP), of which RAFT is one, is still relatively new. This project will give the MHRA an opportunity to examine a novel ATMP from an academic / SME partnership that may first be approved along the hospital 'Specials' route before becoming an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in a clinical trial. The path that we cut together may influence the advise the MHRA gives to other researchers proposing to take this regulatory route. \nAny IP and knowhow generated could be licensed by the commercial private sector to generate future economic return for the University and the companies involved. We already have an excellent track record of collaboration with TAP Biosystems (formerly The Automation Partnership) that we aim to continue here.\nAvailability of reliable models of human tissue and a demonstration of their therapeutic potential could inform policy makers with regards to the direction of future research investment.\nPatients could benefit from this research if it leads to the demonstration that RAFT is a suitable technology for the transfer and survival of stem cells on the ocular surface. Such data would support the need for a clinical trial with the prospect of future product development. If this project is successful, it will provide early safety data for the use of RAFT in the human eye. This will increase our drive to develop additional ocular therapies, using RAFT, to treat diseases with much larger indications. These could include replacement of scarred corneal tissue, delivery of corneal endothelial cells, delivery of cells for retinal degeneration. Success of such approaches would improve quality of life, and make a positive contribution to the economy by alleviating the financial burden on the NHS and by generating new jobs. Such advances would strengthen the UK's position in terms of international research leadership that would in turn attract new economic investment.\nCharities may also benefit by having a tangible cause against which to raise funds.\nThe researchers working on the project will benefit from engaging with scientists from different backgrounds. This will seed new ideas, forge further new collaborations and secure future research funding.",
